is an Associate Professor at the University of Oviedo, Spain. He is the 
founder and main researcher of WESO (Web Semantics Oviedo) research group, which 
collaborates with different companies around the world applying semantic 
web technologies.
The development of data portals for several companies and public administrations led to his interest in RDF validation. He is a 
member of the W3C Data Shapes working group and of three W3C community 
groups—Shape Expressions, SHACL, and RAX 
(RDF and XML interoperability)—as well as the Chairman of the Best practices of Multilingual Linked Open Data community group. 
He implemented the SHACL and ShEx library <em>Shaclex</em> and maintains an online RDF validator service and has also written an introductory book about the Semantic Web in 
Spanish [<a href="bookHtml018.html#Labra2012">54</a>].</p><p><br>
